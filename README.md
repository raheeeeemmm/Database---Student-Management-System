The project contains proper GUI Interface, and Data Saving in a Database SQL.
•	Methodology:

Here is Our Plan and Methodology to Develop the Program.
In this code, the username and password will be asked at first to get in the System. After the credentials are verified, it will take us to next window. There we have to connect to database first to make all buttons working. After connecting to database, we will have following options:
•	Add Student
•	Search Student
•	Deleting Student
•	Update Student
•	Show Student
•	Export Data
•	Exit


•	Working:

After running the code, login window will appear which will ask username and password which is predefined in the code. After logging in there will an option of ‘Connect Database’  and all other buttons but they will not work before connecting. After connecting to Database, we will be able to use all other functionalities. 
ADD STUDENT: It will ask to enter ID, Name, Phone, Email, Address, Gender, and D.O.B. After that the data will be stored in Database.
SEARCH STUDENT: There will be all of the above mentioned options, we can add any details to get the whole detail of a student.
DELETE STUDENT: We have to select the student which we want to delete, then click on Delete button. It will delete those details from Database.
UPDATE STUDENT: We have to select student which we want to update details, and then click on button, it will show all details of that student. Then we can update any detail we want and it will be updated in Database. 
SHOW STUDENT: After clicking on this button, all the students details that are stored in database will be shown.
EXPORT DATA: This functionality is for exporting all the data in Database in an Excel file, which is defined in code that it had to be in “.csv” file.
EXIT: It will close the window and exit the program.
